    <p><strong>METEROLOGISTS</strong> <mark>(scientists who study weather)</mark> measure several elements to describe it accurately.
        ~<strong>TEMPERATURE</strong>:How hot and cold the air is. It is measured by thermometer.
        ~<strong>HUMIDITY</strong>:The amount of water vapour in the air. High humidity makea the air feel sticky.
        ~<strong>AIR PRESSURE</strong>:The weight of the air pressing on Earth's surface, measured by a barometer.

                Today, scientists use <mark style="background-color: rgb(236, 142, 194);">satellites, radar and computers</mark> to <strong>predict weather.</strong>They collect data about temperature, humidity, and wind speed from different places and analyze it. Weather forcasts help people prepare for storms, floods, or heatwaves and save lives. Even a simple phone weather app gives useful daily updates.</p>
