        <p>
        The India-Pakistan cricket rivalry is one of the most intense sport rivalries in the wotld.Showdowns between the teams are considered some of the biggest matches in the world, and are among the most-viewed sport games. The tense relations between the two two nations, resulting from the bitter diplomatic relations and conflict that orginated during the Partition of British India into India and Pakistan in 1947, the Indo-Pakistan wars, and the Kashmir conflict, laid the foundations for the emergence of a fierce sporting rivalry between the two nations who had shared a common cricket heritage.
